1. Using two sequences, input by the user, compute a score matrix. The program has to:
  - Verify that inputs are strings
  - Verify that the strings have only accepted letters 
  - Compute length of each of them. One length is number of rows, the other is number of columns
  - Given number of rows and columns, construct matrix with basic score: (+1 for match, -1 for gap/mismatch)
