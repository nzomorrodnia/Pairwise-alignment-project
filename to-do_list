1. Using two sequences, input by the user, compute a score matrix. The program has to:
  - Verify that inputs are strings
  - Verify that the strings have only accepted letters 
  - Compute length of each of them. One length is number of rows, the other is number of columns
  - Given number of rows and columns, construct matrix with basic score: (+1 for match, -1 for gap/mismatch)

Output matrix as a separate text file or TSV 

# TO DO:

- Implement two different operation modes (DNA, protein)
  - For DNA mode, add a Kimura-like matrix
- Input as a FASTA file
  - Input control and exception handling
- What happens in case of branching?
- Maybe let the user decide the score parameters?

- !Affinity gap!
