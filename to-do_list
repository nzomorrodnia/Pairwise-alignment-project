1. Using two sequences, input by the user, compute a score matrix. The program has to:
  - Verify that inputs are strings
  - Verify that the strings have only accepted letters 
  - Compute length of each of them. One length is number of rows, the other is number of columns
  - Given number of rows and columns, construct matrix with basic score: (+1 for match, -1 for gap/mismatch)

Output matrix as a separate text file or TSV 

# TO DO:

1. Add position numbers for the output for the Smith Waterman algorithm (Nina)
2. Add position numbers for the output for the Needleman-Wunch algorithm (Tom치s)
3. Add user input to choose which kind of alignment to use (global or local)
4. Make sure that all code is clean and has been properly commented (Nina and Tom치s)
5. Add Big O notation (either in code or in report, methods section)
6. Add UNIX commands for user to call the script from UNIX command line
7. Collect all scripts in one python file (one of us when we're done with everything)
8. Insert references to the introduction and theory sections (Tom치s?)
9. Write method section in pseudo code (use package in overleaf):
   9.1: About FASTA handling and Smith Waterman (Nina)
   9.2: About Needleman-Wunch (Tom치s)
   9.3: About all user inputs etc.
10. Write results section with screenshots of output from:
   10.1: Needleman-Wunch algorithm with using both protein sequence and DNA sequence
   10.2: Smith-Waterman algorithm with using both protein and DNA
11. Write conclusion
12. Read through all requirements for the project and make sure we meet them all. 
13. Gather script and report and submit.

OPTIONAL: Add: if the user wants to use BLOSUM
