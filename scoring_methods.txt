1) Basic binary scoring: 
    +1 for match
    0 for mismatch
    -1 for gap

2) More stringent binary scoring:

    +1 for match
    -1 for mismatch
    -1 for gap

3) Binary scoring w/linear gap penalty function:

    +1 for match
    -1 for mismatch
    - g for gap with
        
        g = O + E(k-1)

    where O is opening penalty, E is extension penalty and k is length of gap

4) Complex scoring using scoring matrices:
    
    Scoring matrices compute log-ratios of aminoacid substitution. They are constructed aligning multiple protein sequences
    and assigning a score based on the ratio of the observed mutation frecuency vs the probability of the mutation of appearing
    out of chance. The ratio is then applied a log conversion: positive scores indicate a more frequent mutation, whereas negative
    ones correspond to rare substitutions.
